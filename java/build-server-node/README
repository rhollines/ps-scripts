All integrations use a centralized configuration file "config/coverity-bn-config.xml", which is documented below.  Executing the commands below will display the respective usage information.

Assigns defect owners after a scan has been performed
	The correct SCM plug-in must be configured in the "coverity-bn-config.xml" file.
	script: set-ownership.bat; [options - is_dry_run (true|false)]
	direct: java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.AssignDefectOwners
	
Sets the severity of defects after a scan has been performed
	This integration uses the configuration file "coverity-bn-severity.xml" to map checkers to severities.
	script: set-defect-severity.bat; [options - stream _name, is_dry_run (true|false)]
	direct: java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps/integrations.AssignSeverity
	
Reports - notify defect owners and managers of new defects that have been found in the past N number of days
	Sends an individual e-mail to each defect owner
	script: notify-owners.bat; [options - project_name, number of days in the past, is_dry_run (true|false)]
	direct: java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.reporting.NotifyDefectOwners
	
	Sends an e-mail to the specified leads/managers
	script: notify-managers.bat; [options - project_name, recipients, number of days in the past, is_dry_run (true|false)]
	direct: java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.reporting.NotifyDefectManagers
	
The following wrapper scripts have been provide as a convenience:
	* notify-managers.(bat|sh)
