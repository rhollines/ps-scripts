PSE integration scripts
========================
Order of integrations
0) Export defect
1) assign defect owners
2) set defect severities
3) generate reports

-------------
Build server	
-------------
All integrations use a centralized configuration file that's in the "config" directory.  Executing the commands below will display the respective usage information.

Assign defect owners (runs on a build server or a machine that has access to the SCM system)
	The correct SCM plug-in must be configured in the "coverity-bn-config.xml" file.
	java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.AssignDefectOwners
	
Set defect severities
	This integration uses the configuration file "coverity-bn-severity.xml" to map checkers to severities.
	java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps/integrations.AssignSeverity
	
Reports - notify defect owners and managers
	Sends an individual e-mail to each defect owner
	java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.reporting.NotifyDefectOwners
	
	Sends an e-mail to the specified leads/managers
	java -cp .:lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.reporting.NotifyDefectManagers

-------------
CIM server	
-------------	
Export defect (run on CIM)
	Enable the "Export" button in the CIM.  This is done by putting a file callled "export-defect-handler.(sh|cmd)" into the "<cim_root>/bin" directory.
	
	java -cp .;lib/coverity-ps.jar com.coverity.ps.integrations.bugtracking.ExportDefect <input-file> false
